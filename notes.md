Check list logic (for me) based on gmail check logic

if we select a task directly from the task list the check icon will be a dash and if we press the dash botton unselect the selected ones butttttt if all tasks are selected directly from the task list the check icon will be a "check icon" and will unselect them all.

if we press the check icon and any task are selected will select all the task at once
